# Comparative-Analysis-of-KNN-and-SVM
This repository contains a machine learning project that performs a comparative analysis of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in predicting diabetes based on a set of medical and demographic features.

Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL)

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history

Age: Age in years

Outcome: Class variable (0: non-diabetic, 1: diabetic)
